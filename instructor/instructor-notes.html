<p>[Docker][Docker] and its associated ecosystem is rapidly developing.
While many core features will be stable, the overall environment changes
regularly with version updates and new tools for interacting with Docker
and running containers on different platforms.</p>
<p>In particular, there can be differences between macOS, Windows and
Linux platforms. Updates and changes introduced in Docker releases are
highlighted in the [Docker release notes][Docker release notes].</p>
<p><em>You are strongly advised to run through the lesson content prior
to teaching the lesson to ensure that everything works as
expected.</em></p>
<p>If you experience any issues, please [open an issue][open a lesson
issue] in the lesson repository describing the problem and platform(s)
affected. The lesson maintainers will aim to resolve the issue as soon
as possible but we also welcome the opening of pull requests (linked to
issues) that resolve anything that doesnât work as expected with the
lesson content.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Timing</strong>: With all the lesson episodes taken
together, thereâs way more than three hours of material in this lesson.
Focusing on the earlier episodes (Introduction through the first half of
Creating Container Images) will take just about three hours if you also
include a brief general introduction and time to check your learnersâ
software installations.</li>
<li>
<strong>Install Issues</strong>: From the feedback we have received
about past lessons, computers running Microsoft Windows have encountered
the largest number of challenges setting up Docker. Consider having
people check their install in advance at a separate time or come early.
In online workshops, consider using your video conferencing softwareâs
âbreakout roomâ functionality to form smaller groups within which
participants can troubleshoot their installations. Note that you should
use a more complex command than <code>docker --version</code> to test
the installation, as the simplest <code>docker</code> commands to not
connect to the Docker backend.</li>
<li>
<strong>Virtualization Illustration</strong>: When going through the
intro to containers, consider demonstrating what this might look like by
having two shells (or shell tabs) open, one on your host computer and
one into a container you started before the workshop. Then you can
demonstrate in a simple way that from the same (host) computer, you can
access two different types of environments â one via the shell on your
host computer and one via the shell into a running container. Sample
commands could include:
<ul>
<li><code>whoami</code></li>
<li>
<code>pwd</code> and <code>ls</code>
</li>
<li>something that shows the OS. On mac, this could be
<code>sw_vers</code>, on linux <code>cat /etc/os-release</code>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Reflection Exercise</strong>: At the beginning and end of
the workshop, give participants time to reflect on what they want to get
out of the workshop (at the beginning) and what they can apply to their
work (at the end). Using the shared notes doc is a great way to do this
and a good way to make sure that youâve addressed specific concerns or
goals of the participants.</li>

<p>In this section we provide some details of example learner profiles
and suggest some possible different pathways or technical focuses to
consider when teaching or planning a lesson based around this Docker
material. As such, the information in this section is not designed to
define fixed approaches and structures for teaching this material. It is
instead aimed to provide ideas and inspiration and to encourage you to
think about your audience when preparing to teach this material. The
information here is based on both discussions about the intended
audiences for this material and on direct experiences of instructors who
have taught it at workshops following different technical pathways.</p>

<p>We begin by providing some example learner profiles to highlight the
potential target audience and the types of different research and
technical backgrounds that you may find among learners engaging with
this material. With these profiles, we aim to encourage you to think
about the learners attending your workshop(s) and which episodes it may
be most useful to teach.</p>
<p><strong><em>Nelson is a graduate student in
microbiology.</em></strong> They have experience in running Unix shell
commands and using libraries in R for the bioinformatics workflows they
have developed. They are expanding their analysis to run on 3000 genomes
in 200 samples and they have started to use the local cluster to run
their workflows. The local research computing facilitator has advised
them that Docker could be useful for running their workflows on the
cluster. Theyâd like to make use of existing containers that other
bioinformaticians have made so they want to learn how to use Docker.
They would also be interested in creating their own Docker images for
other lab members and collaborators to re-use their workflows.</p>
<p><strong><em>Caitlin is a second year undergraduate in computer
science examining Docker for the first time.</em></strong> She has heard
about Docker but does not really know what it achieves or why it is
useful. She is reasonably confident in using the Unix shell, having used
it briefly in her first year modules. She is keen to find jump-off
points to learn more about technical details and alternative
technologies that are also popular, having heard that container
technologies are widely used within industry.</p>
<p><strong><em>Xu, a materials science researcher, wants to package her
software for release with a paper to help ensure
reproducibility.</em></strong> She has written some code that makes use
of a series of Python libraries to undertake analysis of a compound. She
wants to (or is required to) make her software available as part of the
paper submission. She understands why Docker is important in helping to
ensure reproducibility but not the process and low-level detail of
preparing a container and archiving it to obtain a DOI for inclusion
with the paper submission.</p>
<p><strong><em>Bronwyn is a PhD student running Python/R scripts on her
local laptop/workstation.</em></strong> She is having difficulty getting
all the tools she needs to work because of conflicting dependencies and
little experience with package managers. She is also keen to reduce the
overhead of managing software so she can get on with her thesis
research. She has heard that Docker might be able to help out but is not
confident to start exploring this on her own and does not have access to
any expertise in this within her local research group. She currently
wants to know how to use preexisting Docker containers but may need to
create her own containers in the future.</p>
<p><strong><em>Virat is a grad student who is running an obscure
bioinformatics tool (from a GitHub repo) that depends on a number of
other tools that need to be pre-installed .</em></strong> He wants to be
able to run on multiple resources and have his undergrad assistant use
the same tools. Virat has command line experience and has struggled his
way through complex installations but he has no formal CS background -
he only knows to use containers because a departmental IT person
suggested it. He is usually working from a Windows computer. He needs to
understand how to create his own container, use it locally, and train
his student to use it as well.</p>
<p>Considering things from a higher level, we also highlight three core
groups of learners, based on job roles, who you may find attending
lessons covering this material. While recognising that there are likely
to be many learners who donât fit into one of the following groups, or
who span more than one of them, we hope that highlighting these groups
helps to provide an example of the different types of skills and
expertise that learners engaging with this material may have:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Researchers:</strong> For researchers, even those based
in non-computational domains, software is an increasingly important
element of their day-to-day work. Whether they are writing code or
installing, configuring and/or running software to support their
research, they will eventually need to deal with the complexities of
running software on different platforms, handling complex software
dependencies and potentially submitting their code and data to
repositories to support the reproduction of research outputs by other
researchers, or to meet the requirements of publishers or funders.
Software container technologies are valuable to help researchers address
these challenges.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>RSEs:</strong> RSEs â Research Software Engineers â
provide software development, training and technical guidance to support
the development of reliable, maintainable, sustainable research
software. They will generally have extensive technical skills but they
may not have experience of working with or managing software containers.
In addition to working with researchers to help build and package
software, they are likely to be interested in how containers can help to
support best practices for the development of research software and
aspects such as software deployment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Systems professionals:</strong> Systems professionals
represent the more technical end of our spectrum of learners. They may
be based within a central IT services environment within a research
institution or within individual departments or research groups. Their
work is likely to encompass supporting researchers with effective use of
infrastructure and they are likely to need to know about managing and
orchestrating multiple containers in more complex environments. For
example, they may need to provide database servers, web application
servers and other services that can be deployed in containerized
environments to support more straightforward management, maintenance and
upgradeability.</p></li>

</h3>
<p>We now come to look at some ideas around learner pathways for
learners interested in Docker, and container technologies more
generally.</p>
<p>Containers involve a variety of different technologies, and teaching
material about them can therefore encompass significant volumes of
technical information. Depending on the domain they work in, and their
motivation for taking a course covering this material, learners are
likely to have various different reasons for wanting to learn about
Docker, that may not necessarily all overlap. The material in this
lesson covers a set of core concepts, introducing containers and then
looking at the key features of Docker and how to use them.</p>
<p>Moving beyond the core features there are a number of topics that are
likely to only be of interest to different sub-groups of learners. To
support these different groups of learners we have developed a set of
â<em>learner pathways</em>â that provide suggested routes through the
material based on different use cases or areas of interest.</p>
<p>You are, of course, welcome to mix and match lesson content to offer
a course that best suits your target audience but we are listing some
different pathways or themes for covering this material to offer you
some guidance and examples of the different routes through the material
that you might want to consider. Each pathway will have a slightly
different emphasis on specific sets of topics. We highlight learner
different profiles that we believe map well to specific pathways.</p>
<p><em>Note that the material in this lesson continues to develop and
experience of teaching the material is increasing. In due course we
intend to offer more detailed pathway information including specific
episode schedules that we think are most suited to the pathways
highlighted.</em></p>
<p><strong>Core content:</strong></p>
<p>The Docker lesson contains a set of core content that we expect to be
relevant for all learner pathways. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introducing container concepts and the Docker software</li>
<li>Running through the basic use of Docker including:
<ul>
<li>Core commands for listing and managing images and containers</li>
<li>Obtaining container images from Docker Hub</li>
<li>Running containers from container images</li>
<li>Building container images</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond this, different pathways offer scope to bring in different
episodes containing different lesson content to support different target
audiences or areas of interest</p>
<p>Some suggested pathways include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Reproducible research</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Common learner profiles:</em> Researcher; RSE</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cloud computing</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Common learner profiles:</em> Sytems professional, RSE</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>High performance computing</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Common learner profiles:</em> Researcher; RSE; Systems
professional</li>

<hr class="half-width">
<ul>
<li>difference between a container and container image</li>
<li>what it means for a container to be stopped (but not removed)</li>
<li>differences in container behaviour between hosts that are running
Linux compared to hosts running macOS or Microsoft Windows
<ul>
<li>on Linux hosts there is usually only one OS kernel shared between
the host and the containers, so less separation than is typical when
using macOS or Windows hosts. This can lead to effects such as volume
mounts behaving differently, e.g., regarding filesystem permissions,
user and group mappings between the host and the container.</li>

    2022-11-07: we have gotten a notification that we have an overage for our
    tracking and I'm pretty sure this has to do with Workbench usage.
    Considering that I am not _currently_ using this tracking because I do not
    yet know how to access the data, I am turning this off for now.
  <script>
    var _paq = window._paq = window._paq || [];
    /* tracker methods like "setCustomDimension" should be called before "trackPageView" */
    _paq.push(["setDocumentTitle", document.domain + "/" + document.title]);
    _paq.push(["setDomains", ["*.preview.carpentries.org","*.datacarpentry.github.io","*.datacarpentry.org","*.librarycarpentry.github.io","*.librarycarpentry.org","*.swcarpentry.github.io", "*.carpentries.github.io"]]);
    _paq.push(["setDoNotTrack", true]);
    _paq.push(["disableCookies"]);
    _paq.push(['trackPageView']);
    _paq.push(['enableLinkTracking']);
    (function() {
          var u="https://carpentries.matomo.cloud/";
          _paq.push(['setTrackerUrl', u+'matomo.php']);
          _paq.push(['setSiteId', '1']);
