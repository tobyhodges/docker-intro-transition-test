   <dt>Dependency</dt>
   <dd>A software dependency is a software library or package that is reused in a different piece of software. For example, a machine learning project might call a Python library to build models. The benefit of software dependencies is that they allow developers to more quickly deliver software by building on previous work.</dd>
   <dt>Dependency hell</dt>
   <dd>A colloquial term for the frustration of some software users who run into issues with software packages which have dependencies on specific versions of other software packages. The dependency issue arises when several packages have dependencies on the same shared packages or libraries, but they depend on different and incompatible versions of the shared packages. If the shared package or library can only be installed in a single version, the user may need to address the problem by obtaining newer or older versions of the dependent packages. This, in turn, may break other dependencies and push the problem to another set of packages.
